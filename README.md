**BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING**
Make sure you create a Mainnet feed on Alchemy and put the URL into alchemy.config.json

Otherwise you will get mysterious error messages when running the hardhat fork.

```npm start``` will start your local fork.

In Metamask, select the "Localhost 8545" network

You will need some USDC in whatever account you want to test with.

I have a helper contract that swaps ETH for USDC and deposits it into my test Metamask account, you can do that if you need to.
